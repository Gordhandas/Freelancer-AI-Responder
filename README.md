## ‚ùó CRITICAL: How to Fix Deployment Errors

If your Netlify deployment is failing, or you are seeing an error message that mentions **"server logs"** or **"API key not found"**, it is because your project contains old, unnecessary files from a previous server-side version.

**To fix this, you MUST DELETE the following from your project folder:**
- ‚ùå **The entire `netlify` folder**
- ‚ùå **The entire `services` folder**
- ‚ùå **The `package.json` file**

After deleting these, commit the changes. The application will then deploy and run correctly as a browser-only tool. This application runs **entirely in your browser**. Your API key is stored in your browser's local storage and is sent directly to Google's servers, not a Netlify function.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Client-Side Operation**: No backend or server setup required. Just open the `index.html` file.

- **Multi-Client Conversation Management**: Maintain separate, organized conversation histories for each client, ensuring context is never lost.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: The AI reads the previous conversation history before generating a new reply, ensuring natural and relevant follow-ups.
- **Adjustable Tone & Style**: Fine-tune the AI's communication by choosing between various tones (Casual, Formal) and styles (Short & Sweet, Detailed).

  - **üöÄ Fast Mode**: Utilizes `gemini-flash-lite-latest` for low-latency, near-instantaneous responses.
  - **üß† Thinking Mode**: Switches to `gemini-2.5-pro` with a maximum `thinkingBudget` to handle complex client questions and generate more thoughtful, in-depth replies.
